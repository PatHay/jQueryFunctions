# jQueryFunctions

Lessons learned from our last time submitting pull requests:

Please be sure to make a folder where you put your work! And name that folder something recognizable so that I can know whose it is!

Do not nest git repos!

1.  FORK this repo. This will give you your own remote repo.
2.  CLONE your repo into your local machine. This will give you a folder that contains this project.
3.  CREATE a folder named with your name (and anyone else you're working with, ideally one or two other people).
4.  ADD your code for the assignment If You Don't Mind to your folder.
5.  PUSH your code to your own remote repo.
6.  Send me a PULL REQUEST.
